                    <p>I have been receiving loans from SAMA for the last 3 years and I have no regrets. Through their support, I have been able to open my salon and barber shop. What I like most about them is their lower interest rates and flexible repayment period.

                    <p>
SAMA has helped me grow by being my emergency cash fund in times of need. I have risen over the levels of membership increasing my loan limits which will be of help in the future.

                    <p>I have used SAMA over 7 months now and it has been the best experience working with them. Their fast disbursment of Loans straight to my phone during emergencies has been the main reason I choose them as my financier.</p>
